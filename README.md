# Alexa Audio Streaming Skill Template

This is an Alexa skill template that provides example code for playing an audio stream. 

### Live example
There is a live example of this skill that you can try from your Alexa device. Just enable the [Dabble Radio Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/Dabble-Lab-Radio/dp/B07JYWFGZ1). You can do that by saying: `Alexa, enable Dabble Radio` and then `Alexa, open Dabble Radio`.

The live skill and this template play a stream that was setup on [zeno.fm](http://stream.zeno.fm/efe91skxn18uv). However, the template will work with any stream that meets the Alexa audio format guidelines. See the [Alexa documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/audioplayer.html) for more information.
